# BMCI Configuration File
# This file defines the sigma (observation uncertainties) and cutoff values for the BMCI retrieval method

# Observation uncertainties for each channel (sigma values)
# These should match the number of input features in your dataset
# Example values for GMI channels - adjust based on your specific use case
sigma = [
    1.0,   # Channel 1
    1.2,   # Channel 2
    1.5,   # Channel 3
    1.1,   # Channel 4
    1.3,   # Channel 5
    1.4,   # Channel 6
    1.6,   # Channel 7
    1.8,   # Channel 8
    2.0,   # Channel 9
    2.2,   # Channel 10
    1.7,   # Channel 11
    1.9,   # Channel 12
    2.1,   # Channel 13
]

# Optional cutoff value for speeding up retrieval
# If specified, samples with weights lower than this threshold will be discarded
# Set to null to disable cutoff (use all samples)
cutoff = 0.001
